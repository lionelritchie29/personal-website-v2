I have experimented several different method of creating a reusable modal with React, but I often find it only work for one or two use cases, 
such as it only works for a confirmation dialog where there will always be *Cancel* and *OK* button. 

Fortunately, I finally found out a method where I could create one base modal which its content could be injected dynamically later by using React Context API 
and implemented it by using the provider pattern.

So, let's get started.

# 1. Preparation

If you want to implement this in your own running project, then skip this step. This step is basically just bootstrapping React with Vite, 
and then setting some UI template to be used later.
(I personally recommend you guys to use Vite by the way, because it's just really fast ðŸš€). 

## Bootstrapping new React App

So, let's create a new React app by using Vite. Open your terminal, and execute this command:

```shell
npm init vite@latest react-reusable-modal-example --template react
```

This will create a minimalist and ready-to-run React app for us. Move to the created directory and install the required dependencies.
```shell
cd react-reusable-modal-example
```
```shell
npm install
```

Next, let's run the app.
```shell
npm run dev
```

Open the project in your prefered text editor (I use Visual Studio Code) and remove everything from `src/App.jsx` and `src/App.css` since we will not use it and overwrite the content.

## Create a Trigger Button
Before we go further, let's create a simple button first. At `src/App.jsx`, 
create a button and position it in the center of the screen. This button will act as a trigger to show the modal.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const mainStyle = {
  display: 'flex',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
  height: '100vh',
  background: '#8946A6',
};

const buttonStyle = {
  padding: '0.75rem 1.25rem ',
  border: 'none',
  background: '#4C0070',
  color: '#FFFFFF',
  fontSize: '1.1rem',
  borderRadius: '0.5rem',
  cursor: 'pointer',
};

const App = () => {
  return (
    <main style={mainStyle}>
      <button style={buttonStyle}>Click Me!</button>
    </main>
  );
};

export default App;
```

# 2. Implementation

## Create our base modal component

Create a new JSX file at `src/components/Modal.jsx`, this will be our base modal component. This component will be responsible to create backdrop 
and add some padding for the content. As for the content itself, it will be injected dynamically and I will show you about that later in this post.

```jsx
import React from 'react';

const modalStyle = {
  position: 'fixed',
  width: '100%',
  height: '100vh',
  top: 0,
  left: 0,
  background: 'rgba(0,0,0,0.75)',
  display: 'flex',
  justifyContent: 'center',
  alignItems: 'center',
};

const modalContentStyle = {
  background: '#FFFFFF',
  padding: '1rem',
  borderRadius: '0.5rem',
  minWidth: '50%',
  maxWidth: '90%',
};

const Modal = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <div style={modalStyle}>
      <div style={modalContentStyle}>{children}</div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Modal;
```

To make sure it work, place it in `src/App.jsx`. Run the app and you should see how our base modal looks. Notice that we use *children* prop in the component so it can render dynamic content for us later. 
You will see how this works out in the next section.

**IMPORTANT**! If the base modal looks good, then remove it from the code, since we will not use it there.

```jsx
...

const App = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <Modal>Content</Modal> // Remove this line after you have checked that it worked
      <main style={mainStyle}>
        <button style={buttonStyle}>Click Me!</button>
      </main>
    </>
  );
};

```

## Create our modal provider

React uses provider pattern in its Context API to share data across the descendant node in the component tree. We can utilize this 
to create our own modal provider which will hold state and methods to manipulate the modal.

Create a new JSX file at `src/providers/ModalProvider.jsx`. This will control the state of our modal and share it to its children
by using the Context API.

First, create a new context. Let's call it `ModalContext`.


```jsx
const ModalContext = createContext(null);
```

Then, create a new state, to store the data for our current modal.
```jsx
const [modal, setModal] = useState({
    show: false,
    content: <div></div>,
  });
```

**Explanation: ** our modal state above have two properties, which are:
1. **show**: to determine whether our modal should be shown or hide, this property will be set to **true** only when the **showModal** method is called and will be set to **false** when the **closeModal** method is called.
2. **content**: content of the modal in JSX.

Create some helper function to close and inject dynamic content to the modal.

```jsx
const showModal = (content) => {
    setModal({
      show: true,
      content,
    });
  };

  const closeModal = () => {
    setModal({
      show: false,
      content: <div></div>,
    });
  };
```

Finally, return our context provider and set `openModal` and `closeModal` function as its value, so it could be used by any descendant component 
in the trees.

Here is the final code:

```jsx
import React, { createContext, useState } from 'react';

const ModalContext = createContext(null);

const ModalProvider = ({children}) => {
  const [modal, setModal] = useState({
    show: false,
    content: <div></div>,
  });

  const showModal = (content) => {
    setModal({
      show: true,
      content,
    });
  };

  const closeModal = () => {
    setModal({
      show: false,
      content: <div></div>,
    });
  };

  return (
    <ModalContext.Provider value={[showModal, closeModal]}>
        {children}
      </ModalContext.Provider>
  );
};

export default ModalProvider;
```

Now, we could combine our recently created modal component with the provider. See the code below, 
Here we use conditional rendering to decide whether we should render the modal or not based on 
the modal state that we have previously created.

```jsx
const ModalProvider = ({children}) => {
  ...

  return (
    <ModalContext.Provider value={[showModal, closeModal]}>
      {modal.show && <Modal>{modal.content}</Modal>}
      {children}
    </ModalContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

# 3. Usage 

Let's test our newly created modal provider. First, we need to wrap our App component inside the `ModalProvider`, so 
let's open `src/main.jsx`, which call our App component, and wrap it using `ModalProvider` component.

```jsx
...
import ModalProvider from './providers/ModalProvider';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <ModalProvider>
      <App />
    </ModalProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root'),
);
```

Then, open `src/App.jsx`. Use the context and set our button's click listener to call the `showModal()` function that we get from the context.

```jsx
const App = () => {
  const [showModal, closeModal] = useContext(ModalContext);

  const showDummyModal = () => {
    const content = <div>Hello, Life is good!</div>;
    showModal(content);
  };

  return (
    <main style={mainStyle}>
      <button style={buttonStyle} onClick={() => showDummyModal()}>
        Click Me!
      </button>
    </main>
  );
};
```

Run the app, then try clicking the button, and **Voila!**, it works!.

Now, to finish it. Let's add a close button for the modal content, and set its onClick method to call the `closeModal` function.

```jsx
const showDummyModal = () => {
    const content = (
      <div>
        <div>Hello, Life is good!</div>
        <button onClick={() => closeModal()}>Close</button>
      </div>
    );
    showModal(content);
  };
```

Now, when we click the close button, the modal will disappear.

Well, that's all about it!. What's so good about this approach is that we could pass a component with its 
own state to the `showModal` function. For example, I could create a **ConfirmationModalContent** component which will always have some text with a *Next* and *Cancel* button, 
and pass it as a parameter to the `showModal` function.
